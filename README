# Marija420

This is the demo of a marijuana store I built  for a client. It possesses both an administrative section and the other users section.
To create an admin account, you have to use an email that ends with administrator.ca
It was built with node, Firebase and React

### To Run

The best way is to visit the heroku website for the deployed website  [Simply Chat](http://www.simplychats.live/).

In terms of usage, as soon as you create a new account, you get the admin user added as a friend to enable you test the private chat and group chat. The admin email is admin@yahoo.com and the password is typing 1 8 times.

### Testing

full jest testing was conducted and the report can be found in the test.json file.
the logs folder also contains a comprehensive details of what the server notes down during the client's interaction
