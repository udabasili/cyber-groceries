# CyberGroceries

This is the demo of a grocery store I built for a client. It possesses both an administrative section and the other user's section.With the administrator section, you get to see manipulate everything related to users like removing / disabling account, completing orders, visualizing user data with Graphs amongst other things

It was built with Node, Firebase, and React
